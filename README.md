# OHECC
This repository provides Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the OHECC (One-Hot Encoded Cartesian Coordinate) representation of molecules and scripts used to train machine learning models using the representation.

The scripts directory contains examples of machine learning based on 3 different methods (XGBoost, random forest, and neural networks) for classification of chiral properties of molecules.

A file containing data for 121,416 molecules is provided by the data set hosted at Zenodo. Please see: https://zenodo.org/records/13380412.
